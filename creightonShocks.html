            The anti-establishment culture that revolves around skating and my similar response to the conception that reading cartoons is an immature or ignorant practice, collectivized when I formed this piece. I wanted to tie these two together in as simple a story arc as possible, so I turned to a common cliche. Boy gets struck by lightning. Boy gets superpowers. Boy faces an obstacle, learns to control his power, and grows. The colors follow this same simplicity including only the primary colors of red, blue, and yellow to establish basic themes, blue is good, red is bad, yellow is the mediator tying these together and pushing our character to his limit.
