                    Obsession: October 18 2020 - Photograph taken by me modified with Adobe Photoshop, includes original Illustration. Album art for the song ‘Obsession’, artist unnamed.
The story of ‘Obsession’ tells of an artist obsessed over their love interest. To create this I took a photo of my subject and painted the background shades of sky blue, to imitate his head being in the clouds only focussed on his love. This thought process I drew up in a large though bubble of overlapping circles to express the grandeur of his ‘Obsession’ adding the title atop the work, encircled and partially covered by the same thought bubbles. Finally, I encircled my subject in a series of stroked silhouettes to emphasize the repetitiveness of an obsession and added some noise for age.

                    Anywhere Else: January 18 2021 - Photograph provided by client modified by me with Adobe 
Photoshop, includes original Illustration. Album art for musician EDWHETT, for his song ‘Anywhere Else’.
The chorus of ‘Anywhere Else’ goes, ‘ever since the devil on my shoulder took over, angels doing nothing but weeping.’ To replicate this line I wanted to express the idea of one's inner devil and angel are just replications of oneself, so I took a silhouette of EDWHETT and flipped it horizontally, painting one black to represent the devil and one white to replicate an angel. The white figure I placed behind bars while the black figure remained in front to give the impression of depth and authority. Finally, I painted the background as a hellish landscape to enforce the idea that the ‘devil… took over.’

                    Georgia on the Radio: December 29 2020 - Photograph taken by me modified with Adobe Photoshop, includes original Illustration. Artwork for ‘Georgia on the Radio’ - University of Santa Cruz Radio Station KZSC 88.1 fm
‘Georgia on the Radio’ is a radio show primarily playing ambient and electronic music. I wanted to replicate this feeling so I chose to seek a more abstract style seen in the fading black and white color scheme that accentuates and pulls the subject into the background as well as the addition of the bright unknown light source I stylized to evoke a feeling of discovery and beginnings.

                    Zerofaith: December 1 2020 - Photograph taken by me modified with Adobe Photoshop, includes original Illustration. Album art for the song ‘Zerofaith’, artist unnamed.
‘Zerofaith’ is a single released for artist, Diablo, that carries demonic and anime-like influences. Red and black were the color scheme I picked to emphasize demonic possession, as well as small horns and a cross necklace as a final ironic touch. This I overlaid with a very noisy texture to mimic the rough beat of the song as well as take away any conception of clarity or pureness antithetical to how demons are often perceived. I took this same approach in finding an appropriate font, and finally decided upon Trattatello for its rough and pointed nature.
